Hi! I am a recent PhD gradate with a background in Evolutionary Biology and Bioinformatics. For the past few years I have worked in various genomics projects (research, classes, and clubs).

Check out my project page to read a little more about my [current projects](/projects). Additional information of past projects can be found in the [Resume](/resume) tab. Also, please [shoot me a message](/contact) if you would like to talk about how awesome it is to be a dog owner, share something cool about bioinformatios, or to just talk about science in general.
