<div id="Hi!">
  <br/>
  <h1>Hi!</h1>
  <p>I am a recent PhD gradate with a background in Evolutionary Biology and Bioinformatics. For the past few years I have worked in various genomics projects (research, classes, and clubs).</p>
  <p>Check out my project page to read a little more about my [current projects](/projects.md). Additional information of past projects can be found in the [Resume](/resume.md) tab. Also, please [shoot me a message](/contact.md) if you would like to talk about how awesome it is to be a dog owner, share something cool about bioinformatios, or to just talk about science in general.</p>

  <p>My open-source projects started as a fun hobby, but as my tools and content got more popular, it has turned into a full-time job commitment (often taking up 20-40 hours per week). Except with 0 pay and no employer benefits :) My goal is to be able to focus as much as I can on <strong>open-source work that benefits the entire community</strong> rather than individual clients, and I can only reach that goal by getting supported for my hard work.</p>
