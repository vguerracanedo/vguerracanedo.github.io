  <h1>Hi!</h1>
  <p>I am a recent PhD gradate with a background in Evolutionary Biology and Computational Biology. For the past few years I have worked in various genomics projects (research, classes, and clubs).</p>
  <p>Check out my <a href="/projects">project page</a> to read a little more about my current projects. Additional information of some of my past projects can be found in the <a href="/resume">resume</a> tab. Also, please <a href="/aboutme">shoot me a message</a> if you would like to talk about how awesome it is to be a dog owner, share something cool about bioinformatics, or to just talk about science in general.</p>
